World Cup 2014 wall chart

This program provides a digital version of the common wallchart for the 2014 Fifa Football World Cup. It allows the scores in each game to be entered and updates the chart accordingly, transferring the winning team to the next stage or updating the groups. Match schedules, UK TV channel, and location are also displayed.
The system also includes a goals counter, keeping a count of how many goals each team has scored. This was used for a competition to select the highest scoring team from each global region. This display is included on a separate tab, along with my (unfortunately way off) guesses.
